# pyQGIS


Examples of automating QGIS procedures with python 
Files in this repository include: 

- "0.1 AIANNH AdjCounties.py": This script uses QGIS to find the percent to assign weighted population averages to reservations based on counties within buffers of [X, Y, Z] miles. 

- "3.3 FindDistances.py" : uses geopy to calculate geodisic distance between any two arrays of unique points. 

- "1.2 join population with block.py" : finds the population within a [X, Y, Z] mile buffer radius of each ~8million census blocks in the united states. Splits population by race.
